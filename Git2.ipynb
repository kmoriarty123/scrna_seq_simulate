    "for some additional context on the impact of Git). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the popularity of Git, especially in the scientific software community\n",
    "(we are not aware of a single piece of serious, widely used open source\n",
    "software in the field that does offer its code in a Git repository), **we will\n",
    "be using Git as our VCS of choice throughout this course**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is **fast, free, open source** and comes preinstalled on most Mac and Linux\n",
    "machines. It stores a project's history as a directed graph, with a root, edges\n",
    "(\"branches\"), nodes and leaves (\"commits\"). Commits represent snapshots of a\n",
    "project's state, and given Git's distributed nature (i.e., users work on a\n",
    "clone of the entire code repository, not just the current state) it is easy to\n",
    "traverse the tree to go back in time, roll back changes or to compare one state\n",
    "of the project with another (which makes code review a breeze). Branches\n",
    "represent different lines of work and they can be used for various purposes,\n",
    "e.g., maintaining multiple versions of your software or keeping stable,\n",
    "fully-tested code separately from features that are currently being\n",
    "implemented. Generally, there is one default branch (typically the `main` or,\n",
    "formerly, the `master` branch - depending on your version of Git). This is also\n",
    "often referred to as a _stable branch_, _release branch_ or _production branch_.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that while Git is designed as a distributed nature, it doesn't mean that\n",
    "> there cannot be a central, authoritative repository in Git workflows. It just\n",
    "> allows you _not_ to have one, if it happens to suit your project's needs. In\n",
    "> reality, though, most open source software projects _will_ make use of such a\n",
    "> _blessed_ repository, and so will we.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other important property of Git is that it distinguishes between three\n",
    "different environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **working directory**  \n",
    "  This is your current directory structure and corresponds to the state of the\n",
    "  project on your file system.\n",
    "* The **staging area**  \n",
    "  This includes all changes _staged_ to be included in the next commit.\n",
    "* The actual **local repository**  \n",
    "  This represents the current state of the commit you are currently viewing\n",
    "  (also referred to as the HEAD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you create a fresh Git repository from an empty directory, clone a\n",
    "repository from a Git server or pull the latest changes from a remote\n",
    "repository to your local copy (more on the latter two later), there will be no\n",
    "difference between the working directory and the HEAD, and the staging area\n",
    "will be empty. But once you start adding or editing files to the directory\n",

    "* [**\"GitLab flow\"**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html)\n",
    "  (medium complexity)  \n",
    "  This branching model builds on the GitHub flow and includes guidelines for setting up optional production (to deploy code from development whenever the time is right), environment and release branches on top of the default/main branch and feature branches; this is useful for situations where intensive testing is required prior to deployment (e.g., staging, pre-production, production deployments and corresponding environment branches), when deployments are scheduled or where multiple explicitly versioned releases of a software are to be released \n",

    "   the Git history to completely remove such information. String patterns\n",
    "   matching file and directory names to be included can be indicated in various\n",
    "   places, most often in a version-controlled `.gitignore` file that is placed\n",
    "   in the repository root directory. However, patterns for files that you want\n",
    "   to exclude for all repositories and that are specific to your work\n",
    "   environment (e.g., editor-specific artefacts such as lock and backup files),\n",
    "   you should rather indicate globally. Have a look at the [\"gitignore\"\n",
    "   documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) to find out how to use\n",
    "   it. We also recommend that you make use of the\n",
    "   [gitignore.io](http://gitignore.io/) service that auto-generates \"gitignore\"\n",
    "   patterns for you based from a wide list of keywords (e.g., `Python`,\n",
    "   `VisualStudioCode`, `Linux`). Given the importance of configuring Git to\n",
    "   ignore certain files, we have included the generation of a `.gitignore` file\n",
    "   in the homework below.\n",
    "2. **Create single-purpose commits with semantic commit messages**  \n",
    "   Analogous to the [single-responsibility\n",
    "   principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)\n",
    "   of software development, a commit should wrap only functionally and/or\n",
    "   semantically related changes. For example, if you find a typo in your\n",
    "   project's documentation while you are working on something else, do not\n",
    "   just fix it along with your other changes. It's easier to review code that\n",
    "   is consisting of the least possible number of lines. It's also easier to\n",
    "   roll back buggy code without any additional side effects. Finally, it will\n",
    "   make for a clean commit history and changelog, so that users of your\n",
    "   software can track its development and the release of new features and bug\n",
    "   fixes. In this regard, we strongly recommended that you describe your\n",
    "   commits using concise (up to 50 characters in the title line) semantic\n",
    "   commit messages following the\n",
    "   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)\n",
    "   specification. It may be painful at first, but learning it early should\n",
    "   prevent you from adopting bad practices, and it comes with multiple\n",
    "   benefits, including a clean and consistent commit history, the ability to\n",
    "   create changelogs, bump versions according to the widely used [Semantic\n",
    "   Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) specification and even publish\n",
    "   entire releases automatically (in Python, e.g., with the\n",
    "   [`python-semantic-release`](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "   package).\n",
    "3. **Do not rewrite history**  \n",
    "   Once you push code to a public repository, others are able to pull the code\n",
    "   and work on it (which you may not necessarily be aware of). If you change\n",
    "   the commit graph between the time point that someone has checked out the old\n",
    "   history tree and the time point they are trying to merge their new code, Git\n",
    "   will not be able to resolve the resulting conflicts, causing much justified\n",
    "   frustration. Apart from creating irresolvable conflicts, rewriting history\n",
    "   can also lead to contributions being misattributed to different people\n",
    "   (imagine someone rewriting your paper, stripping your name and replacing the\n",
    "   old version with the new one on the publisher's website) and difficulties in\n",
    "   tracking the progress of your project. Of course, as with (almost) every\n",
    "   guidelines, there are valid exceptions: For example, in some Git workflows,\n",
    "   including the one we are using, the history of a _feature branch_ (but not\n",
    "   a release/stable branch) can be rewritten in order to clean up or squash\n",
    "   commits before merging. Here, by convention, the assumption generally holds\n",
    "   that only a single person is working on a iven feature branch agt a time.\n",
    "   Another exception is when you inadvertently commit sensitive information to\n",
    "   your repository (see above). Clearly, in such a situation even rewriting a\n",
    "   stable branch may become necessary.\n",
