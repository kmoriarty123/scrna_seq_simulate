    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important concept implemented in most, if not all, programming languages is the principle of *encapsulation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that code should be written in a modular manner, each functionality being implemented in a piece of code that communicates with the rest of the code via an interface. This has many advantages, such as \n",
    "\n",
    "* each piece of code can be written and tested *independently* of other code\n",
    "* the values of variables in that code will not be inadvertently changed somewhere else in the program\n",
    "* the code can be easily shared and reused\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it becomes much easier to ensure that a particular functionality is implemented correctly, it can be optimized without affecting other parts of a program, and once the development of the code is complete, it does not have to be revisited when another part of the program is modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, encapsulated code can be conveniently reused without having to worry how it does what it does, just like a *black box*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        ____________\n",
    "       | BLACK  BOX |\n",
    "       |            |\n",
    "input ==> f(input) ==> output\n",
    "       |            |\n",
    "       |____________|\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output produced by the code in the black box is just a function of its input.\n",
    "\n",
    "There a various levels or layers of encapsulation. Python's functions and methods are one example of encapsulation. "

In contrast *kind* is an `instance variable`, its definition being linked to a specific instance of the class, which is why the full name of the varible is `self.kind`. We can modify this behavior by redefining the *markers* variable for each instance. Nevertheless, we still have access to the class variable as illustrated below.

    "Another very general purpose module that we should look at is `argparse`. It provides a wide range of functionalities associated with the parsing commandline arguments, enforcing the correct use of programs. The full documentation on the module can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html. Here we will go through a few important features of this module. The basic idea is to constructs an object containing all the relevant information about the commandline arguments that we expect and use this object to parse the commandline, extracting the individual arguments. While we may have done this ourselves in other programming languages, parsing the commandline to extract arguments and ensure that they have the correct type, range etc. is really tedious and error-prone. Let's look at the most basic way of using the module:"

In this case, it specifies that what needs to happen is to store the constant that is also an argument to the method, namely the build-in function `sum` into the `accumulate` variable.

    "Packages are also the container that is used most commonly to publish Python projects.\n",
    "Over the years, innumerable packages have been written for Python that one can *install* and use. The biggest resource for Python packages is the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/), more commonly referred to as PyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages can be installed via the package manager Pip that should be automatically installed together with Python\n",
    "(you can verify that it is available with `pip --version`). When installing a package that is listed in PyPI,\n",
    "the syntax is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install package_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `package_name` is the name of the package you would like to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "When installing a package, Pip fetches the code from a repository and stores it in an efficient way on your local file system so that you can use it in the future. The location where packages are stored is pre-configured and typically does not need to be modified. If you want to find out where a given package was installed, you can run `pip show package_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to know that Pip can also be used to install packages from sources other than PyPI, e.g., from Git repositories:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install code from default branch\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/user/repo.git\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install code from specific branch/tag/commit\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/user/repo.git@branch/tag/commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Pip can also be used to install a Python package from the current directory. For this, we need to be in the root directory of the project, and there needs to be that contains a `setup.py` file (more on that below). If available, you can execute the following command to install your local package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful to install a Python project that you are currently working on.\n",
    "In that case, it is best to install the package in an \"editable\" manner by providing the `-e` flag when installing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```"

    "## Creating & publishing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already learned that what makes a directory containing Python modules a package is the presence of an `__init__.py` module, so that's simple enough. But if we want to publish/distribute our package, we need to do a few more things:\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Annotate your package with metadata**_\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously instructed you to create a directory `code/` inside of your Git repository root directory and put all your actual code inside that subdirectory. We did this so that all the code is nicely located together in one directory and is not mixed up with configuration files etc. (e.g., `.gitignore`). As such, the `code/` (the name is not important) subdirectory is effectively your package, and all files and directories inside it are (sub)modules and subpackages of that package.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to annotate the package and provide the instructions required for PyPI to store and Pip to install the package, we need to create a file `setup.py` inside the repository root directory (i.e., _outside_ of the package).\n",
    "\n",
    "A very minimal `setup.py` file could look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n",
    "\n",
    "setup(\n",
    "    name='mypackage',\n",
    "    url='https://gitlab.com/my_user_name/my_package.git',\n",
    "    author='My Name',\n",
    "    author_email='me@email.org',\n",
    "    description='Brief package description',\n",
    "    license='MIT',\n",
    "    version='1.0.0',\n",
    "    packages=find_packages(),  # this will autodetect Python packages from the directory tree, e.g., in `code/`\n",
    "    install_requires=[],  # add here packages that are required for your package to run, including version or range of versions\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify these values to fit your needs and most of these should be fairly obvious. We would like to point out two good practices though:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Never publish any code without a **license**! Commonly used code licenses in the Open Source Software community are the MIT, Apache 2.0 and GPL-based licenses. We recommend you use the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for a start. See [this resource](https://choosealicense.com/) for further info and additional licenses.\n",
    "2. It is very useful (particularly for users of your software) to explicitly **version your code**. We strongly recommend you adhere to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification for this purpose, a 3-part versioning system (a fourth part is optional) composed of major (for breaking changes to the software's interface), minor (for backwards-compatible changes to the software's interface) and patch (for changes that do not change the software's interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `setup()` function can take additional metadata information as [listed here (incomplete)](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#additional-meta-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "_**(Optional) Create command-line executables from your code**_\n",
    "\n",
    "As scripts that can be executed from the commandline are commonplace in the life sciences, we would like to point out that it is possible to have `setup()` conveniently create commandline executables from your Python code that execute a specific function. All you need to do is at the following to your `setup()` call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "setup(\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    entry_points = {\n",
    "        'console_scripts': ['my-executable=mypackage.my_module:main'],\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we tell `setup()`: _\"Create an executable `my-executable` that executes the function `main()` in module `my_module` of package `mypackage`.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "> By convention, we often call the function that\n",
    "> serves as an entry point for command-line scripts `main()`.\n",
    "> See [above](#On-executing-Python-scripts-from-the-command-line)\n",
    "> for an example and how to guard this sort of code against accidental execution when importing from the module that contains that function. In your homework you will write such a `main()` function that parses the user's commandline arguments and provides them as input to the code you have previously written.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Build the package for distribution**_\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare your package for publication, simply execute Python's `build` module, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python -m build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a look at your directory after executing the command, you will see that `build` created a directory `dist/` for you, which contains compressed files that we need to publish the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Upload the package to the Python Package Index (PyPI)**_\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be ready to publish your package!\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you are sure that your software is ready to be used by others (or you have at least a strong desire to get there soon),\n",
    "we recommend you _not_ to publish to PyPI just yet. Nothing will stop you from doing so, but there is not much point in\n",
    "flooding [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) with test software or half-baked code. Instead,\n",
    "we can publish the code to the [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/).\n",
    "By the way, publishing to Test PyPI is also good practice for serious/production releases -\n",
    "just to make sure that your package ends up on the index just like you want it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To upload the package to Test PyPI, we make use of the `twine` module and tell it to upload the contents of the\n",
    "`dist/` folder to `testpypi`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing this command will ask you for your **username and password**, so make sure you register with Test PyPI first.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To upload to PyPI instead, simply omit the `--repository` parameter and its argument. Note that you need to\n",
    "> register with PyPI and Test PyPI indvidually, their user databases are not shared!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should now be available on Test PyPI for a while. You and others can install the package with Pip using\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple mypackage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `mypackage` is the name of the package. The arguments to `--index-url` and `--extra-index-url` tell Pip to find `mypackage`\n",
    "on Test PyPI but find any dependent packages (if your code requires them) from the regular PyPI."

Put the CLI code in module `cli.py` inside the `code/` directory. Import the functional code from module `transcript_sampler.py`. Make sure that code in module `cli.py` is only executed when called from the command line, not when imported.\n",
    "4. Add a `setup.py` file to your repository root, create a package and publish it to Test PyPI. Make sure `setup.py` contains a console script entry point definition that points to the main function of the `cli.py` module. Give your package and executables suitable names (verify first that a package with your chosen name does not already exist on PyPI). Note that your package will be removed from Test PyPI after a while. This is fine as we do not want to store our test packages permanently.\n",
