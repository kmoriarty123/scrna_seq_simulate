    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important concept implemented in most, if not all, programming languages is the principle of *encapsulation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that code should be written in a modular manner, each functionality being implemented in a piece of code that communicates with the rest of the code via an interface. This has many advantages, such as \n",
    "\n",
    "* each piece of code can be written and tested *independently* of other code\n",
    "* variables in that code will not be inadvertently changed somewhere else in the program\n",
    "* the code can be easily shared and reused\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it becomes much easier to ensure that a particular functionality is implemented correctly, it can be optimized without affecting other parts of a program, and once the development of the code is complete, it does not have to be revisited every time the functionality needs to be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, encapsulated code can be conveniently reused without having to worry how it does what it does, just like a *black box*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        ____________\n",
    "       | BLACK  BOX |\n",
    "       |            |\n",

    "       |____________|\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output produced by the code in the black box is just a function of its input.\n",

The `add_marker` function allows us to construct the list of markers defining the cell type.\n",

This is because *markers* was defined as a `class variable`, which all instances share and modify. In contrast `kind` is a `instance variable`, its definition being linked to a specific instance of the class, which is why we full name of the varible is `self.kind`. We can modify this behavior by redefining the *markers* variable for each instance. Nevertheless, we still have access to the class variable as illustrated below. In contrast to some other programming languages, Python does not prevent us from accesses all members of a class, variables and methods, via the <kbd>.</kbd> notation, i.e. they are *public*, not *private* to the class.

A package (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) is a collection of modules, organized in a hierarchical manner on the file system (directories-sunbdirectories-files), and having in addition an `__init__.py` file in each of these directories. The `__init__.py` file can just be empty, can contain code that will be executed upon import (initialization code), or set the `__all__` variable. This variable contains the list of module names that should be imported when the instruction `from package import *` is encountered. However, it is not recommended to use this instruction, but rather use explicitly import of desired modules. The items to be imported can be not only submodules, but also other names defined in the package, such as functions, classes or variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where does Python look for packages?\n",
    "\n",
    "When the import statement is encountered, Python checks whether the item to be imported is defined in the package, and  if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts to load it, using the directories specified in the list variable `sys.path`. This is initialized from the environment variable PYTHONPATH, or, if this is not set, from a built-in default. This variable an be modified, for e.g. \n",

Packages support a special attribute, __path__, initialized to be a list containing the name of the directory holding the package’s __init__.py before the code in that file is executed.

Containers can be created for various tools, versions of software etc., allowing reproducibility of analyses across architectures and users as well as the sharing of functionality.

However, Docker provide ways to deal with this. One is to mount a host file system into the container. This can be done either with the `--volume` or with the `--mount` option. The difference is in how they handle files/directories that do not exist yet on the Docker host. `--volume` creates these **but always as directories**, while the latter gives an error. More about bind/mount at https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/.\n",

    "A really nice illustration of encapsulation is *application program interfaces* (*APIs*), which are pieces of software that interact with other pieces of software via defined interfaces. They allow us to access/retrieve data stored on web servers/databases and then locally save or process and analyze that data. \n",

    "* [Twitter API documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/)\n",
    "* [YouTube API documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/)\n",

    "[Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/) is a public resource of genomes and a wealth of related information, developed and maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute. While it is possible to browse it and manually retrieve information of interest to you, it also offers a pretty neat (and fairly new) [REST API](https://rest.ensembl.org/) that allows you to programmatically access a large fraction of their data programmatically via the programming language of your choice. This gives you access to the most recent version of a database/service and you do not have to worry about versions of the data (typically these are stored on the web server and can be accessed as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a REST API? A proper explanation would include a lot of info on the architecture of the internet and, more specifically, the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP), which is way beyond the scope of this course. For now, a REST API gives you the opportunity to query remote databases via *uniform resources locators (URLs)* (i.e. web addresses). That is, by assembling a web address according to certain rules, we can get exactly the information we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs define different endpoints (i.e. different URL stems) to retrieve (or post, update...) data entries. These stems can then by modified by parameters (very similar to a function's or method's arguments) to get you what you want in the form that you want. Endpoints of Ensembl's REST API are listed here: https://rest.ensembl.org/. Unfortunately, not all databases are represented. Nevertheless, let's see how we can retrieve a genomic sequence via the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The endpoint we are using for our example is called \"GET sequence/id/{sequenceID}\".\n",
